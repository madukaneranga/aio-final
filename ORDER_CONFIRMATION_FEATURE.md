# Order Confirmation Feature Implementation

This document describes the newly implemented order confirmation system that ensures customers confirm delivery within 14 days or orders are automatically confirmed.

## Feature Overview

After a seller marks an order as "delivered", customers now have 14 days to confirm they received the order. If they don't confirm within this timeframe, the system automatically confirms the order as "completed".

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Changes (Order Model)

**New Status:**
- Added `completed` status to order status enum

**New Fields:**
- `deliveredAt`: Date when seller marked order as delivered
- `customerConfirmationDeadline`: Date (deliveredAt + 14 days) by which customer must confirm
- `confirmedAt`: Date when customer manually confirmed delivery
- `autoConfirmedAt`: Date when system auto-confirmed (if customer didn't confirm)

### 2. Backend Changes

**Order Routes (`/backend/routes/orders.js`):**
- Modified status update route to set delivery tracking dates when status changes to "delivered"
- Added new route `PUT /api/orders/:id/confirm-delivery` for customer confirmation
- Updated notification messages to inform about 14-day confirmation requirement

**Auto-Confirmation System:**
- `utils/orderAutoConfirmation.js`: Core logic for processing auto-confirmations and sending reminders
- `utils/scheduler.js`: Simple scheduler that runs maintenance tasks every hour
- Integration with main server to start/stop scheduler

**Features:**
- Automatically confirms orders after 14 days from delivery
- Sends reminder notifications 3 days before deadline (on day 11)
- Completes wallet transactions and updates store sales when orders are confirmed
- Sends notifications to both customers and store owners

### 3. Frontend Changes (Orders.jsx)

**New UI Elements:**
- "Completed" filter option and status styling
- "Confirm Delivery" button for customers on delivered orders
- Delivery confirmation countdown showing days remaining
- Auto-confirmation policy information
- Different styling for confirmed vs auto-confirmed orders

**Customer Experience:**
- Clear visual indicator when order is delivered and needs confirmation
- Countdown showing remaining days for confirmation
- Easy one-click confirmation process
- Automatic transitions to review system after completion

### 4. Notification System Updates

**New Notification Types:**
- `order_reminder`: For 14-day confirmation reminders
- `payment_update`: Enhanced payment status notifications

**Enhanced Notifications:**
- Delivery notifications now mention 14-day confirmation requirement
- Auto-confirmation notifications for both customer and store owner
- Reminder notifications sent 3 days before deadline

## User Flow

### For Customers:
1. Seller marks order as "delivered"
2. Customer receives notification about delivery with 14-day confirmation requirement
3. Customer can confirm delivery immediately or within 14 days
4. System sends reminder notification on day 11
5. If not confirmed by day 14, system auto-confirms
6. Order status changes to "completed"
7. Customer can then leave reviews

### For Store Owners:
1. Mark order as "delivered" (sets 14-day timer)
2. Receive notification when customer confirms or system auto-confirms
3. Sales are updated when order is completed

## Technical Details

### Auto-Confirmation Process
- Runs every hour via scheduler
- Finds orders with status "delivered" past confirmation deadline
- Updates status to "completed" and sets `autoConfirmedAt`
- Completes wallet transactions and updates store sales
- Sends notifications to both parties

### Reminder System
- Runs every hour via scheduler  
- Finds orders delivered exactly 11 days ago
- Sends reminder notifications to customers
- Calculates and displays days remaining

### Error Handling
- Prevents double-confirmation
- Handles deadline validation
- Graceful error handling for notifications and wallet updates
- Prevents confirmation after auto-confirmation

## Configuration

The system is configured to:
- 14-day confirmation window (configurable in code)
- Hourly scheduler runs (configurable in scheduler.js)
- Reminder sent on day 11 (configurable in auto-confirmation logic)

## Benefits

1. **Customer Protection**: Ensures customers have adequate time to report delivery issues
2. **Seller Protection**: Prevents indefinite pending status for delivered orders
3. **Automated Process**: Reduces manual intervention and support tickets
4. **Clear Communication**: Customers know exactly what's expected and when
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of manual vs auto-confirmations

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Configurable confirmation periods per store or product type
- Multiple reminder notifications (e.g., day 7 and day 12)
- Integration with shipping tracking systems
- Email notifications in addition to in-app notifications
- Admin dashboard for monitoring confirmation rates
